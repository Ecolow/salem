SUMMARY

In an effort to seek employment and improve my programming and analytical skills, I spent a month creating a job market analysis tool capable of applying precisely to job offers I would myself consider.

ABSTRACT 

The online job market represent % of all applications sent to companies. The application process has been streamlined enough that the longest part of applying for a vacancy is still... searching. Picking the offers from a dense stream of haystack and text based search, while obviously practical, is rather limited (see part recursive) and biased (see part X) as well.
Moreover, not all offers fits an applicant's interest or expectation. And an applicant does not necessarely fit all requirements. Thus, it would be conterproductive for a job seeker to apply to all offers regardless.
Would it be possible to a new type of search, with different metrics ?
